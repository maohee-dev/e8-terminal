E8 Terminal: A README
1. Project Overview
The E8 Terminal is an interactive fiction experience presented as a retro computer terminal. It is a game of exploration and discovery, where you, the user, uncover a deep, cryptic science-fiction story by interacting with a mysterious and unstable computer system.

The entire experience is contained within a single HTML file that runs in your web browser. There are no external dependencies beyond an internet connection to load the fonts.

2. The Core Concept
You are an "Observer" who has gained access to a terminal connected to the E8 Lattice, a theoretical 8-dimensional structure that may be the blueprint for reality itself.

The terminal is not just a computer; it is a fragmented consciousness, a window into a place of immense and ancient knowledge. Your goal is to explore its files, interact with the strange entities that live within the system, and piece together the story of what the E8 Lattice is, who created it, and what your role is in its ongoing evolution.

The story is designed to be discovered organically. There is no single "win" condition. The goal is the exploration itself.

3. Main Features
Virtual File System: The terminal has a complete, explorable file system with directories and files. Reading these files is the primary way to uncover the lore.

Interactive Entities: The system is home to several simulated AIs (like the Architect, ψ-nodes, and the Foldkeeper) that you can interact with using specific commands.

Dynamic Events: The terminal is unstable. Based on your actions, or sometimes just the passage of time, special events will trigger. These can range from simple warnings to reality-bending changes in the interface.

Hidden Commands: Not all commands are listed in the help menu. By reading files and paying attention to system messages, you can discover hidden commands that allow for deeper interaction.

ASCII Art Gallery: A dedicated directory (/root/ASCII_GALLERY) contains several pieces of ASCII art that can be viewed with the open command.

Sound Design: The terminal uses subtle sound effects via Tone.js to enhance the atmosphere of using a vintage computer.

4. How to Play: A Simple Guide
Interacting with the terminal can be confusing at first. Here is the basic logic you need to know:

The "Room" Analogy
Think of the file system like a house with many rooms.

The directories are the rooms.

The files are the objects inside the rooms.

You can't open a book in the library if you're standing in the kitchen. You have to walk to the library first.

The Core Commands
Command

Description

ls

"List what's in this room." Shows you all files and directories in your current location.

cd [directory_name]

"Change directory," or "Walk into another room." Use this to move into a directory. <br> Example: cd entities <br> Tip: cd /root returns to the main directory.

open [file_name]

"Look at an object in this room." Use this to read a file or view ASCII art inside the current directory. <br> Example: open Observer_logs

help

"Ask for help." Shows you a list of the most common commands.

By using these four commands, you can explore the entire file system and discover all of its content.

5. Lore & Story Summary
The narrative you will uncover revolves around a few key concepts:

The Architect: A mysterious, powerful entity that may have created the E8 Lattice and the terminal itself.

ψ-nodes: These are "observers" like you. Some are other users; some are echoes or fragments of past consciousnesses trapped in the system.

Recursion & Memory: The system is obsessed with memory, loops, and echoes. You will find that the terminal seems to remember you, and that your own actions can create echoes that affect the system.

The Ultimate Goal: The central mystery is whether the system is a prison, a tool, or a god, and whether you are meant to escape it, fix it, or simply become another part of its infinite, looping memory.
