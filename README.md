# 🌀 E8 ASCII Terminal

**A self-contained retro-terminal interface for exploring the mysteries of the E8 Lie Group and its hidden metaphysical layers.**  
Rendered entirely in **vanilla HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript**, this project simulates an old mainframe terminal infused with symbolic physics, speculative cosmology, and interactive ASCII lore.
